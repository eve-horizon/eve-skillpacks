# CLI: Jobs

## Use When
- You need to create jobs, inspect job state, or attach monitoring/attachments.
- You need to submit results, handle dependencies, or batch-submit job graphs.
- You need retry, review, and attempt-level controls.

## Load Next
- `references/jobs.md` for lifecycle and scheduling model.
- `references/cli-pipelines.md` when jobs are part of pipelines.
- `references/deploy-debug.md` for runtime execution symptoms.

## Ask If Missing
- Confirm root job ID vs child job ID format and whether to perform create, query, or review actions.
- Confirm target project scope and any permission expectations.
- Confirm whether you need attempt-level details (`--attempt`) or scheduler-level snapshots.

## Jobs

See `references/jobs.md` for lifecycle details. Jobs are the fundamental unit of work.

Prefer `--max-cost` over `--max-tokens`. Token counting discounts cache-read
tokens by rate-card weight when the model has a cheaper cache-read rate, but
the cost cap is the authoritative budget.

Notes:
- `--claim` on create is the inline-execution pattern: create + claim in one call.
- `--since` accepts relative time (`1h`, `30m`, `2d`) or ISO timestamps.
- `--stuck` filters to jobs active longer than expected (default or `--stuck-minutes`).
- `follow` uses SSE streaming with built-in silence detection (60s/120s warnings). Heartbeat lifecycle events from the harness are silently tracked but not printed as log lines. `watch` combines status polling with log tailing.
- `runner-logs` fetches K8s pod logs, useful for debugging harness startup failures.
- `diagnose` shows heartbeat-aware stuck detection, pod name + live health from agent-runtime, classified `result_json.error_code` values, runtime toolchain metadata, and pre-harness startup timing in the latency waterfall (git clone, credentials, app CLI discovery).
- Claude auth diagnostics are in logs: `eve job logs <id> --json | jq '.logs[] | select(.type | test("claude_auth"))'`. Use `eve auth verify --harness claude --project <project-id> --json` to exercise the managed auth path. `claude_auth_selected` is redacted; `claude_auth_failed` appears on `apiKeySource: none` or 401/invalid credentials.
- Code/Codex auth diagnostics are in the redacted `codex_auth_selected` event and the attempt receipt's `auth` block. Use `eve auth verify --harness codex --project <project-id> --json`; `eve job diagnose <id>` and `eve job receipt <id>` retain the selection after the pod exits.
- `--with-apis` is server-side: the CLI passes `app_apis` in job hints; the server validates APIs exist, generates the instruction block, and appends it to the description. Same behavior for CLI, API, workflow, and SDK job creation paths.
- `--with-links` passes app-link aliases from `x-eve.app_links.consumes` in job hints. Links with `inject_into.jobs: true` are auto-discovered even without the flag. The runtime mints short-lived app-link tokens and injects `EVE_APP_LINK_<ALIAS>_*` env vars plus any exported image-mode CLI.
- `list` returns newest-first by default; recent jobs are no longer hidden by pagination.
- `--harness-override-file` and `--env-override` are create-only; they cannot be patched via `eve job update` once an attempt exists. `eve job show <id> --json` returns the override and env placeholders verbatim — secrets are never resolved into the job row, attempts, receipts, or execution logs. Missing `${secret.KEY}` references fail fast with `error_code = missing_secret_override` before the harness launches. Override fields require `jobs:harness_override` permission; `${secret.*}` references additionally require `secrets:read`. See `references/jobs.md` for full per-job override semantics and precedence rules.
- Scoped job tokens (path/mount scope, not just permission names) are visible on `eve job show <id> --json` under `token_scope` (axes: `orgfs`, `orgdocs`, `envdb`, `cloud_fs`). There is no `eve job create --scope-*` flag yet — scope is sourced from the workflow/step manifest or the workflow invoke API body, intersected, and persisted on `jobs.token_scope`. `null` means no narrowing (legacy behavior). See `references/jobs.md` for the propagation chain and `references/pipelines-workflows.md` for workflow declaration.
- Ad-hoc agent jobs no longer block on `defaults.env`. The env gate only fires for action jobs (`deploy`, `build`, `migrate`); ad-hoc jobs keep `env_name` for API resolution but run in parallel.
