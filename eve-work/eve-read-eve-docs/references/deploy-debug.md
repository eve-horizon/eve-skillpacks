# Deployment + Debugging (Current)

## Use When
- You need to troubleshoot deploy, ingress, namespace, or runtime worker issues.
- You need environment-specific diagnostics or service status during incident response.
- You need K8s architecture behavior for local or staging deployments.

## Platform Release Ownership

Keep platform artifact publication separate from instance rollout:

1. `eve-horizon/eve-horizon` publishes seven service images when a maintainer
   pushes one explicit `release-v*` tag. Publishing does not deploy.
2. `eve-horizon/eve-horizon-infra` supplies the public Terraform/Kustomize
   template; it does not own a live environment.
3. The private deployment-instance repo pins `platform.version`, owns cluster
   credentials, and performs the rollout under its owner's runbook.

Never add cluster credentials or `repository_dispatch` rollout coupling to the
public source repo. For a hosted upgrade, verify the source publish first, then
switch to the target instance repo, bump the pinned version, review the diff,
and deploy from there.

## Deploy Error Classes (DeployFailure kinds)

The deployer classifies deploy failures and writes the kind to both the attempt
log (`error_context.kind`) and `environments.last_deploy_failure_json`. CLI
commands (`eve pipeline logs`, `eve job diagnose`, `eve env show`) render the
kind plus a "Next step" hint. Kinds:

| Kind | Cause | Next step |
|------|-------|-----------|
| `k8s_api_error` | Kubernetes API returned an unexpected error | Share attempt_id with support; full body is in the log. |
| `manifest_invalid` | K8s rejected the manifest (400/422) or manifest drift vs ref | `eve manifest validate`; if drift, `eve project sync --ref <sha>`. |
| `image_pull_error` | `ImagePullBackOff` / `ErrImagePull` | Check `imagePullSecret` and image digest; run `eve env diagnose`. |
| `app_crash_loop` | Container exits non-zero on start | `eve env logs <project> <env> <service> --previous`. |
| `readiness_timeout` | Pods up but not passing readiness probes | Check `eve env diagnose`; review probe definitions. |
| `dependency_timeout` | `depends_on` service never became healthy | `eve env logs <project> <env> <dep-service>`. |
| `ingress_conflict` | Another env owns the hostname (first-bind-wins) | `eve domain list`; `eve domain transfer <host> --to <env>`. |

Object-store bucket deploy failures:
- `Eve object storage is not configured`: the worker cannot provision buckets.
  On AWS staging, check the worker overlay for `EVE_STORAGE_BACKEND=s3`,
  `EVE_STORAGE_REGION`, `EVE_STORAGE_INTERNAL_BUCKET`,
  `EVE_STORAGE_ORG_BUCKET_PREFIX`, `EVE_STORAGE_APP_BUCKET_PREFIX`, and
  `EVE_STORAGE_PUBLIC_ENDPOINT`. Do not set worker
  `EVE_STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY_ID` or `EVE_STORAGE_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` on AWS; the
  worker uses its own IRSA role to provision buckets.
- `isolation mode 'irsa' is not available`: a manifest explicitly requested
  `x-eve.object_store.isolation: irsa`, or `auto` was expected to choose IRSA,
  but the worker is missing `EVE_OIDC_PROVIDER_ARN`, `EVE_OIDC_PROVIDER_URL`,
  `EVE_APP_BUCKET_ROLE_PREFIX`/app bucket prefix, public storage endpoint, or
  IAM permissions for role/policy management. Local k3d should use `auto` or
  `shared`; explicit `irsa` is expected to fail fast there.
- Missing `EVE_APP_STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `EVE_APP_STORAGE_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`:
  static credential isolation (`shared` or local `minio-static-key`) was
  selected, but the worker cannot inject app-facing credentials. On local k3d,
  verify MinIO env vars. On AWS, prefer IRSA; only verify the `eve-app-storage`
  secret if deliberately using shared static app credentials.
- Unexpected static keys in an AWS app pod: `auto` did not resolve to IRSA.
  Check `eve env diagnose <project> <env> --json` for
  `.storage_buckets[].isolation_mode`; expected AWS value is `irsa` with
  `iam_role_arn` and `service_account`.

For request-specific failures after an app is deployed, use the CLI-first
request ladder:

```bash
eve env diagnose <project> <env> --request req_01h... --window 120 --json
eve env logs <project> <env> <service> --follow --filter req_id=req_01h...
eve traces query --project <project> --request-id req_01h... --json
```

`env diagnose --request` keeps "not found" as structured empty data with
warnings, not a command failure. Optional audit-log rows are included when a
service declares `x-eve.audit_log_table`.

When a deploy applies the manifest but fails to reach readiness, `eve env show`
reports `Current Release` with `(last ready)` and a separate `Last Applied`
line flagged `DRIFT — cluster differs from last-ready`. Both are persisted in
`environments.current_release_id` (last ready / rollback base) and
`last_applied_release_id` (actually in the cluster).

### Pipeline manifest resolution

Pipeline runs resolve `manifest_hash` from the deploy ref's manifest, not from
"latest manifest at run-create time". Pushing a manifest fix and immediately
running `eve env deploy --ref <new-sha>` picks up the new manifest without a
separate `eve project sync` step. CLI auto-sync (when `--repo-dir` contains
`.eve/manifest.yaml`) and the server-side resolver agree on the hash for the
ref. If the ref's manifest cannot be resolved, the deploy fails fast with a
clear error rather than silently using a stale hash.

## Custom Domain Ownership

Custom domains are env-scoped with **first-bind-wins** semantics. The first env
to deploy with a hostname under `x-eve.ingress.domains` owns it; later deploys
of other envs that reference the same hostname log `owned by environment "<A>"`
and skip rendering the ingress. Move ownership with:

```
eve domain list                                      # hostname → env mapping
eve domain transfer <host> --to <env>                # DB-only ownership move
eve env deploy <losing-env>                          # removes stale ingress
eve env deploy <new-owner-env>                       # creates new ingress
```

`eve domain unbind <host>` clears the binding without picking a new owner.

## Load Next
- `references/cli.md` for command-based diagnostics.
- `references/pipelines-workflows.md` if the issue is pipeline-triggered.
- `references/builds-releases.md` for build/release failure context.

## Ask If Missing
- Confirm runtime mode (`k8s` vs `docker`) and `EVE_API_URL`.
- Confirm environment name, namespace, and whether this is staging or local.
- Confirm which command already ran and what exact output/error was returned.

## Default Environment

Default to **staging** for user guidance. Use local/docker only when explicitly asked for local development.

## Runtime Modes

| Mode | `EVE_RUNTIME` | Purpose | Runner Execution |
|------|---------------|---------|------------------|
| Kubernetes | `k8s` | Integration, staging, production | Ephemeral pods |
| Docker Compose | `docker` (default) | Local dev iteration | Local process |

Agent runtime hot path is configured separately with `EVE_AGENT_RUNTIME_EXECUTION_MODE`:
- `inline` (default): execute directly in warm runtime pods
- `runner`: fallback to per-attempt runner pod execution

## K8s Architecture

- **API, Orchestrator, Worker**: Deployments in the `eve` namespace (worker is not per-env).
- **Postgres**: StatefulSet with 5Gi PVC.
- **Runner pods**: Ephemeral pods spawned per job attempt for isolated execution.
- **Ingress**: Access via `http://api.eve.lvh.me` -- no port-forwarding needed.

When web auth is enabled, the stack also runs:
- **supabase-auth (GoTrue)** at `auth.<domain>`
- **sso** at `sso.<domain>`
- **mailpit** at `mail.<domain>` (local only)
- **auth bootstrap job** for GoTrue DB role provisioning

```bash
./bin/eh k8s start     # Start k3d cluster + apply manifests
./bin/eh k8s deploy    # Build images + deploy stack
./bin/eh k8s status    # Check status
```

### Runner Pod Reaper

The worker runs a periodic reaper that cleans up orphaned runner pods and PVCs after job completion. Prevents resource leaks if the worker restarts mid-poll. Settings: `EVE_RUNNER_REAPER_ENABLED`, `EVE_RUNNER_REAPER_INTERVAL_MS`, `EVE_RUNNER_REAPER_GRACE_SECONDS`.

### Secrets Provisioning

1. Define secrets in `system-secrets.env.local` (e.g., `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`).
2. Run `./bin/eh k8s secrets` to sync `system-secrets.env.local` plus auth-derived keys into the K8s secret `eve-app`.
3. Restart deployments that consume `eve-app` (`eve-api`, `eve-orchestrator`, `eve-worker`) so updated env values are loaded.
4. API reads system secrets as baseline for all environments.

### Ingress Routing

```
Pattern:   {service}.{orgSlug}-{projectSlug}-{env}.{domain}
Example:   api.myorg-myproj-staging.eve.example.com
Namespace: eve-{orgSlug}-{projectSlug}-{env}
```

Domain resolution: 1) manifest `x-eve.ingress.domain`, 2) `EVE_DEFAULT_DOMAIN`, 3) no ingress if neither set. Local dev uses `lvh.me` (resolves to 127.0.0.1). Production: set `EVE_DEFAULT_DOMAIN=apps.yourdomain.com`.

### HTTP Ingress Timeouts and Body Size

Services can tune HTTP ingress behavior without raw controller annotations:

```yaml
x-eve:
  ingress:
    public: true
    port: 3000
    timeout: 600s
    max_body_size: 100m
```

- `timeout` sets nginx `proxy-read-timeout` and `proxy-send-timeout` for the
  service's primary, alias, and custom-domain ingresses.
- `max_body_size` sets nginx `proxy-body-size` for the same ingress set.
- Platform defaults are `EVE_DEFAULT_INGRESS_TIMEOUT=300s` and
  `EVE_DEFAULT_INGRESS_MAX_BODY_SIZE=10m`; manifest values override them.
- Valid ranges are `1s`-`30m` and `1k`-`1g`. Use Eve jobs for longer work and
  signed uploads/object storage for larger payloads.
- Phase 1 emits L7 tuning only when `EVE_DEFAULT_INGRESS_CLASS` is `nginx` or
  `nginx-ingress`. Traefik/unknown classes skip these annotations; explicit
  tenant tuning logs a deploy warning.

Diagnostics:

```bash
eve env diagnose <project> <env>                    # renders HTTP Ingress table
eve env diagnose <project> <env> --json | jq '.http_ingress'
```

### Public TCP Ingress

Services can declare `x-eve.tcp_ingress` for public raw TCP protocols. The
deployer renders a separate `Service` of type `LoadBalancer` labelled
`eve.tcp_ingress=true`; normal ClusterIP service behavior and HTTP ingress are
unchanged.

Providers:
- `none`: validate only; no public TCP Service.
- `klipper`: local k3d/k3s LoadBalancer.
- `aws-nlb`: internet-facing AWS Network Load Balancer; requires
  `deployment/aws-load-balancer-controller` in `kube-system`.

Diagnostics:

```bash
eve env diagnose <project> <env>                    # renders TCP Ingress table
eve env diagnose <project> <env> --json | jq '.tcp_ingress'
eve tcp-ingress test <project> <env> --listener a1-gt06
```

`env diagnose` reports each listener as:
- `pending`: manifest opts in but the LoadBalancer Service is absent.
- `provisioning`: Service exists but has no external hostname/IP yet.
- `ready`: Kubernetes reports an external hostname or IP.

`eve tcp-ingress test` performs a TCP connect from the CLI host and exits
non-zero on failure. It does not validate the device protocol payload.

Local k3d needs raw TCP ports mapped at cluster creation:

```bash
./bin/eh k8s start --tcp-ports 33400,33500 --recreate
./bin/eh k8s deploy
```

Common checks:
- `eve env diagnose <project> <env> --json | jq '.tcp_ingress'`
- `./bin/eh kubectl get svc -A -l eve.tcp_ingress=true`
- Verify each listener port appears in the service's manifest `ports`.

### Custom Domain Ingresses

Apps can bring their own domains via `x-eve.ingress.domains` on a base service
or inside `environments.<env>.overrides.services.<svc>.x-eve.ingress.domains`
(see `references/manifest.md` for the schema). Domains are auto-registered
during manifest sync and also by the deployer before binding. A hostname
declared in exactly one env override is bound to that env during sync. Use
`eve domain register <host> --project <id> --service <svc> --env <env>` for
manual reservations. Each custom domain gets a separate K8s Ingress resource
labeled `eve.custom_domain=true`. During
deploy, the deployer checks DNS (A/CNAME) against `EVE_PLATFORM_INGRESS_IP`
/ `EVE_PLATFORM_INGRESS_HOSTNAME`. `EVE_PLATFORM_INGRESS_IP` accepts a
comma-separated list (e.g. `52.209.1.195,52.17.16.223`) for multi-AZ load
balancers — DNS verification matches any of the listed IPs against the A
records. If DNS is verified, the Ingress is applied and cert-manager
provisions a per-domain TLS cert via HTTP-01. Unverified domains stay in
`pending_dns` — use `eve domain verify <hostname>` to perform real DNS
resolution and transition to `dns_verified`, then redeploy to activate.

Services that omit `x-eve.ingress.alias` still get custom-domain ingresses
when `x-eve.ingress.domains` is set; the deployer no longer requires an alias
to render the per-domain Ingress.

Stale custom domain ingresses (removed from manifest) are garbage-collected on re-deploy via label selector. The `custom_domains` database table tracks lifecycle states: `pending_dns`, `dns_verified`, `cert_provisioning`, `active`, `dns_error`, `cert_error`, `removed`.

### Debugging Custom Domains

```bash
eve domain list --project <id>                      # All domains + owning env
eve domain register <host> --project <id> --service <svc> [--env <env>]
eve domain status <hostname> --project <id>         # Per-domain DNS / cert state
eve domain verify <hostname> --project <id>         # Re-run DNS resolution
eve env diagnose <project> <env>                    # Pulls in per-env custom-domain status
```

`eve domain status <host> --json` includes stable `owner_env`, `dns_state`,
`cert_state`, and `last_verified_at` fields for automation.

`eve env diagnose` includes the per-env custom-domain rows alongside pod state,
so an `ingress_conflict` failure or a `pending_dns` domain shows up in the same
output as the failing service.

### Ingress TLS

Use cert-manager for automatic TLS on app ingresses. Set `EVE_DEFAULT_TLS_CLUSTER_ISSUER` (e.g., `letsencrypt-prod`) to enable per-host certs via cert-manager annotations. Optionally set `EVE_DEFAULT_TLS_SECRET` for a wildcard cert or `EVE_DEFAULT_INGRESS_CLASS` for a specific ingress controller.

**Custom domains ignore `EVE_DEFAULT_TLS_SECRET`** — wildcard certs don't cover user-owned FQDNs. They always use `cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer` with HTTP-01 challenges. If the ClusterIssuer only has DNS-01 solvers, add an HTTP-01 solver for non-platform hostnames.

## Private Endpoints (Tailscale)

Platform networking primitive that makes Tailscale-only services (e.g., LM Studio on a Mac Mini, internal APIs) accessible to all cluster workloads. Uses the Tailscale K8s Operator to create egress proxies via ExternalName Services.

> Tailscale Private Endpoints handle **inbound** access from cluster pods to
> Tailscale-reachable services. For **outbound** stable source-IP egress (UDP
> hole-punching, vendor APIs that need a stable client port), see "Stable
> Egress" below — that uses `hostNetwork: true` on a public-egress node group,
> not Tailscale.

### How It Works

```
K8s Pod → K8s Service (eve-tunnels ns) → Tailscale Operator Egress Proxy → WireGuard → Tailnet Device
```

Every private endpoint gets a stable in-cluster DNS name:
```
http://<orgSlug>-<name>.eve-tunnels.svc.cluster.local:<port>
```

This URL works from any pod: app pods, agent runtime, workers, runners.

### CLI Commands

```bash
# Register a private endpoint
eve endpoint add \
  --name lmstudio \
  --provider tailscale \
  --tailscale-hostname mac-mini.tail12345.ts.net \
  --port 1234

# List / show / diagnose
eve endpoint list
eve endpoint show lmstudio --verbose
eve endpoint diagnose lmstudio

# Remove
eve endpoint remove lmstudio
```

### Wiring to Apps and Agents

Private endpoints integrate via standard BYOK secrets:

```bash
# Set the endpoint URL as a secret
eve secrets set LLM_BASE_URL \
  "http://myorg-lmstudio.eve-tunnels.svc.cluster.local:1234/v1" \
  --scope project

eve secrets set LLM_API_KEY "lm-studio-xxx" --scope project
```

Reference in manifests or agent profiles via `${secrets.LLM_BASE_URL}`.

### Diagnostics

`eve endpoint diagnose <name>` checks: operator running, K8s Service exists, egress proxy created, DNS resolution, TCP connectivity, HTTP health check. Status transitions: `pending` -> `ready` or `error`.

### Prerequisites

The Tailscale K8s Operator must be installed once per cluster (k3d, staging, production). The Eve API service account needs RBAC to create/delete Services in the `eve-tunnels` namespace.

**k3d shortcut**: If the host Mac is already on Tailscale, k3d containers can typically route to `100.x.x.x` addresses directly. Use raw `eve secrets set` to point at the Tailscale IP instead of `eve endpoint add`.

## Stable Egress

Different problem from Private Endpoints. Stable egress gives an **opted-in
service** endpoint-independent UDP NAT mappings on outbound traffic —
typically to fix UDP hole-punching, STUN-discovered NAT traversal, or any
vendor protocol that depends on a stable source-port across destinations.
The cluster NAT Gateway breaks all of these because it does symmetric
port translation.

Opt in from the manifest:

```yaml
services:
  api:
    x-eve:
      networking:
        egress: stable
```

See `references/manifest.md` for schema. EKS only — k3d treats the field as a
no-op and logs a warning.

### How It Works

There is no sidecar, no Secret, no tunnel. On EKS opt-in, the platform
deployer renders the pod with `hostNetwork: true` and schedules it onto a
dedicated managed node group whose nodes have their own associated public
IPv4. Traffic exits through the node's primary ENI directly to the Internet
Gateway, which performs **1:1 NAT** (port preserved across destinations).

```
app container (hostNetwork: true)
  ↓ binds in the node netns, pod IP = node primary IP
node primary ENI (10.0.x.y)
  ↓ Internet Gateway 1:1 NAT
node public IPv4 (54.x.y.z) → vendor / Internet
```

Cluster prerequisites (handled by infra repo):
- `eks-egress-pool` Terraform module provisions the node group with the
  `eve.io/egress-pool=stable` label and matching `NoSchedule` taint.
- `egress-snat-bypass` DaemonSet inserts an early-RETURN rule above the AWS
  VPC CNI's MASQUERADE in `AWS-SNAT-CHAIN-0`, so hostNetwork traffic is
  not re-NAT'd with `--random-fully` (which would otherwise restore
  symmetric NAT).
- Worker deployment has `EVE_COMPUTE_MODEL=eks` set so the deployer's
  hostNetwork render path activates on opt-in.

### Verifying Injection

```bash
# Pod has hostNetwork + dnsPolicy + egress-pool selector + EVE_NETWORK_EGRESS
kubectl -n <ns> get pod -l eve.component=<service> -o yaml \
  | grep -E 'hostNetwork|dnsPolicy|egress-pool|EVE_NETWORK_EGRESS'
# Expect: hostNetwork: true, dnsPolicy: ClusterFirstWithHostNet,
#         eve.io/egress-pool: stable, EVE_NETWORK_EGRESS env var present.

# Pod IP matches the egress node's primary IP
kubectl -n <ns> get pod -l eve.component=<service> -o wide
kubectl get nodes -l eve.io/egress-pool=stable -o wide
```

### Verifying Egress Behavior

The diagnostic helper in the infra repo runs three checks from a single
local UDP socket — same-socket STUN is the only valid way to classify
endpoint-independent vs address-and-port-dependent NAT.

```bash
INFRA=../deployment-instance
kubectl -n <ns> cp $INFRA/scripts/stable-egress/udp-diag.py <pod>:/tmp/udp-diag.py -c <container>
kubectl -n <ns> exec <pod> -c <container> -- python3 /tmp/udp-diag.py
```

Read the output:

| Check | Pass | Fail |
|-------|------|------|
| `egress public IP` | Equals the egress node's `EXTERNAL-IP` (`kubectl get nodes -l eve.io/egress-pool=stable`). | Equals the cluster NAT Gateway EIP — pod isn't actually running with hostNetwork or isn't on an egress node. Verify scheduling. |
| STUN classification | `endpoint-independent (good)` — same external port across all three STUN servers, equal to the local socket port. | `address/port-dependent` — `egress-snat-bypass` DaemonSet is missing or its rule got evicted by a CNI restart. |
| UDP/53 to 1.1.1.1 | OK in <100 ms. | UDP egress broken entirely. Different problem. |

### Common Failure Modes

| Symptom | Likely Cause |
|---------|--------------|
| Pod stuck `Pending` with event `0/N nodes are available: ... eve.io/egress-pool selector unsatisfied` | Egress node group is not provisioned. Set `stable_egress_enabled = true` in the infra repo, then `terraform apply`. |
| Pod renders without `hostNetwork: true` | Worker is missing `EVE_COMPUTE_MODEL=eks`. Render falls through to the no-op path. Re-roll the worker overlay. |
| Render error: `Phase 1 requires replicas=1` | Multi-replica hostNetwork services are Phase 2 (need anti-affinity + cluster-wide port-collision validation). Set `replicas: 1` for now. |
| Render error: `port(s) ... in the Kubernetes NodePort range (30000-32767)` | EKS node SG opens NodePort range from `0.0.0.0/0` for NLB traffic. Pick a service port outside that range. |
| Egress IP equals the egress node's EXTERNAL-IP, but STUN ports differ across servers | `egress-snat-bypass` DaemonSet not running on the egress node. Check `kubectl -n eve get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/name=egress-snat-bypass` and inspect `iptables -t nat -L AWS-SNAT-CHAIN-0` on the node — there should be an early `RETURN` rule for the node's primary IP, before the SNAT. |
| Vendor relay still times out but STUN passes | NAT semantics are correct; the remaining issue is app/vendor-specific (firewall on vendor side, expired credentials, decommissioned relay host, app-level retry). Reopen the protocol diagnosis at app level. |

## Continuous Environment Monitoring (Sentinel)

The orchestrator runs an `EnvHealthWatchdogService` cron that periodically
diagnoses every active environment, classifies pod health
(`ImagePullBackOff`, `CrashLoopBackOff`, unresolved env-var interpolation,
long `Pending`), upserts state into `environment_health_checks`, and posts
transitions to the configured Slack channel via the platform notification
service. The orchestrator queries K8s directly (its own `eve-orchestrator`
ServiceAccount has read access to pods/events plus `deployments/scale`); the
watchdog needs `environments.namespace` to be populated, which the deployer
now persists before readiness checks so freshly-deployed envs are discovered
on the next tick.

When an environment stays degraded for `EVE_ENV_HEALTH_STABLE_TICKS` ticks
and breaches the circuit-breaker thresholds (default: `CrashLoopBackOff` with
>50 restarts, or any terminal failure for >30 min), the watchdog scales the
failing Deployment to zero and marks `environments.deploy_status='failed'`.
The Deployment is preserved (not deleted) so `eve env diagnose` keeps full
context; a subsequent `eve env deploy` redeploys normally.

Configuration (orchestrator env vars):

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `EVE_ENV_HEALTH_ENABLED` | `false` | Master kill switch — opt in |
| `EVE_ENV_HEALTH_INTERVAL_MS` | `120000` | Tick cadence |
| `EVE_ENV_HEALTH_STABLE_TICKS` | `2` | Consecutive degraded ticks before action |
| `EVE_ENV_HEALTH_CIRCUIT_BREAK_ENABLED` | `true` | Gate scale-to-zero |
| `EVE_ENV_HEALTH_CIRCUIT_BREAK_AFTER_RESTARTS` | `50` | CrashLoop trigger |
| `EVE_ENV_HEALTH_CIRCUIT_BREAK_AFTER_MS` | `1800000` | Time-in-failure trigger |
| `EVE_SENTINEL_COST_TOP_N` | `5` | Environment rows shown in the daily cost summary |
| `EVE_SENTINEL_COST_STALE_AFTER_HOURS` | `26` | Age after which cost snapshots are labelled stale |

Slack channel + workspace are stored as system settings
(`sentinel.slack.integration_id`, `sentinel.slack.channel_id`,
`sentinel.enabled`). Notifications are deduplicated within a 4h window per
environment+signature.

The daily Sentinel report also appends a month-to-date environment cost
section when cost snapshots exist. This section reads only
`environment_cost_snapshots` from Postgres; it never calls billing APIs or
OpenCost during Slack send. It labels data as `fresh estimate`,
`stale estimate`, or `unavailable`, includes shared platform overhead, and
points operators to `eve system env-cost --all` for the full breakdown.

Environment cost collection is opt-in and cloud-neutral. The orchestrator
collector speaks the OpenCost allocation API and writes snapshots; OpenCost
itself is provisioned/configured in the infra repo, not by Eve application
deploys. Collector env vars:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `EVE_ENV_COST_COLLECTOR_ENABLED` | `false` | Master kill switch |
| `EVE_ENV_COST_COLLECTOR_CRON` | `0 * * * *` | Refresh cadence for MTD snapshots |
| `EVE_OPENCOST_URL` | unset | In-cluster OpenCost allocation API base URL |
| `EVE_ENV_COST_SHARE_IDLE` | `false` | Attribute idle cost to envs instead of shared overhead |
| `EVE_OPENCOST_TIMEOUT_MS` | `10000` | OpenCost fetch timeout |

OpenCost outages do not delete last-good snapshots. The CLI and Sentinel
summary surface stale or unavailable state instead.

## Managed DB TLS Trust

The worker deployer mounts a namespace-scoped CA bundle into every app
Deployment and job pod when the environment has at least one cloud managed
DB tenant (`aws-rds`, `gcp-cloudsql`):

- ConfigMap `eve-db-trust` in the env namespace contains the per-provider PEM bundle.
- Pods receive volume mount `/etc/eve/trust/ca-bundle.pem` plus env vars
  `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` and `PGSSLROOTCERT` pointing at it.
- Cloud tenant URLs default to `sslmode=verify-full`. Local managed instances stay on `sslmode=disable`.

Apps no longer need `ssl: { rejectUnauthorized: false }` — the platform owns
trust distribution. The shared trust registry lives at
`packages/shared/src/managed-db/trust/`. See `references/database-ops.md` for
how this surfaces in app code and migration jobs.

If managed DB connections start failing with TLS verification errors after a
deploy:

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `self signed certificate in certificate chain` from Node `pg` | Pod missing the trust bundle (deployed before trust injection landed, or env has no managed DB tenants) | Re-deploy; check `kubectl -n <ns> get cm eve-db-trust`. |
| `no pg_hba.conf entry for host ... SSL off` | URL was rewritten with `sslmode=disable` by the old resolver | Confirm `DATABASE_URL` carries `sslmode=verify-full`; the orchestrator now inherits sslmode from the source URL. |
| Migration job fails but app pods connect | Job pod missing trust mount | Job render path also injects the bundle; re-deploy and check the Job pod spec. |

## Worker Image Registry

Pre-built images on public ECR eliminate local builds and ensure consistent toolchains.

| Image | Public ECR Path | Contents |

| full | `public.ecr.aws/w7c4v0w3/eve-horizon/worker-full:<ver>` | All toolchains (default) |

### Versioning + Pinning

- **Version tags**: `0.1.0`, `0.1.0-py3.11` (from git tag `worker-images/vX.Y.Z`).
- **SHA tags**: `sha-a1b2c3d` (every build, for commit-level pinning).
- **Multi-arch**: `linux/amd64` + `linux/arm64`.

Configure via `EVE_RUNNER_IMAGE` on the worker deployment. Pin to semantic versions in production. Use SHA tags or `latest` for dev/CI only.

## Worker Toolchain-on-Demand

The default worker runs the `base` image (~800MB: Node.js, git, harnesses). Toolchains (Python, Rust, Java, Kotlin, media/ffmpeg) are injected via init containers only when needed.

### How Init Container Injection Works

When a job declares toolchains (via agent config or workflow step), the orchestrator adds init containers to the runner pod:

```
Runner Pod
  Init: tc-python  → copies /toolchain/* to /opt/eve/toolchains/python/
  Init: tc-media   → copies /toolchain/* to /opt/eve/toolchains/media/
  Container: runner → base image, PATH extended with toolchain bins
```

Each toolchain image is small (50-300MB). Init containers finish in <1s if the image is cached on the node. First pull adds ~5-10s.

### Toolchain Images

| Toolchain | Contents | Size |
|-----------|----------|------|
| `python` | Python 3, pip, venv, uv | ~100MB |
| `media` | ffmpeg, ffprobe, whisper-cli + ggml-small.en model | ~300MB |
| `rust` | rustup, stable toolchain, rustfmt, clippy | ~400MB |
| `java` | Temurin JDK 21 | ~300MB |
| `kotlin` | kotlinc 2.0 + JDK 21 (self-contained) | ~350MB |

Images published to ECR: `public.ecr.aws/w7c4v0w3/eve-horizon/toolchain-{name}:{version}`

### Environment Setup

The entrypoint sources per-toolchain `env.sh` files and extends `PATH`:

```bash
# Automatic: entrypoint.sh handles this
export PATH="${EVE_TOOLCHAIN_PATHS}:${PATH}"
# Per-toolchain env.sh sets JAVA_HOME, RUSTUP_HOME, CARGO_HOME, etc.
```

### Deployment Impact

- Default worker variant changed from `full` to `base` (CI and local k3d)
- `EVE_WORKER_VARIANT=full` restores the old fat image if needed
- Agents without `toolchains` field are unaffected (no init containers)
- Configure toolchain image prefix/tag: `EVE_TOOLCHAIN_IMAGE_PREFIX`, `EVE_TOOLCHAIN_IMAGE_TAG`
- Local k3d: build + import toolchain images with `./bin/eh k8s image --toolchains`

### Debugging Toolchain Issues

If a job fails with "command not found" for a toolchain binary:
1. Check the agent config declares `toolchains: [<name>]`
2. Check init container logs: `kubectl -n eve logs <pod> -c tc-<name>`
3. Verify the toolchain image exists: `docker pull <prefix><name>:<tag>`
4. Fallback: set `EVE_WORKER_VARIANT=full` on the worker deployment

## Docker Compose Runtime (Dev Only)

Optimized for fast local iteration. **Security note:** exposes services on localhost with simple defaults -- never run in shared or internet-exposed environments.

```bash
./bin/eh docker auth    # Extract auth credentials from host
./bin/eh start docker   # Start the stack
```

| Aspect | Docker Compose | K8s (k3d) |
|--------|----------------|-----------|
| Startup | ~10s | ~60s |
| Prod parity | Moderate | High |
| Runner pods | No (local process) | Yes (ephemeral) |

## Local Multi-Project Mesh

Use `eve local mesh` for k3d verification when two or more Eve projects talk
through `x-eve.app_links`.

```bash
export EVE_API_URL=http://api.eve.lvh.me
eve local mesh init obs --org org_manualtestorg --env local
eve local mesh add prod --path ../producer
eve local mesh add cons --path ../consumer
eve local mesh up
eve local mesh status
eve local mesh diagnose --probe
eve local mesh redeploy cons
eve local mesh down
```

The platform stack must already be running. Mesh project names are Eve project
slugs and every project should declare `environments.local`. The command syncs
and deploys producer projects before consumers, and it can build/import
producer `Dockerfile.cli` images into k3d for app-link job CLI injection.

## First Deploy Quickstart

The fastest path from zero to a running deployment. Create a minimal `.eve/manifest.yaml`:

```yaml
schema: eve/compose/v2
project: my-app

registry: "eve"

services:
  app:
    build:
      context: .
    ports: ["3000"]
    x-eve:
      ingress:
        public: true

environments:
  sandbox:
    pipeline: deploy

pipelines:
  deploy:
    steps:
      - name: build
        action: { type: build }
      - name: release
        depends_on: [build]
        action: { type: release }
      - name: deploy
        depends_on: [release]
        action: { type: deploy, env_name: sandbox }
```

Then deploy with two commands:

```bash
eve project sync --dir .
eve env deploy sandbox --ref main
```

Key points:
- **`registry: "eve"`** uses the Eve-native container registry -- no external registry setup needed.
- **`image` is optional** when `build` and `registry` are configured -- the platform derives image names from service keys.
- **`eve env deploy` auto-creates** the `sandbox` environment because it is defined in `manifest.environments`. No separate `eve env create` step is required.
- The pipeline builds, releases, and deploys in sequence. Access the app at `http://app.{orgSlug}-{projectSlug}-sandbox.{domain}`.

## Deploying Environments

```bash
eve env deploy staging --ref main --repo-dir ./my-app
eve env deploy staging --ref <40-char-sha>
```

If `environments.<env>.pipeline` is set, `eve env deploy` triggers that pipeline. Use `--direct` to bypass. `--ref` must be a 40-char SHA or a ref resolved against `--repo-dir`/cwd. When `--repo-dir` is provided and the directory contains `.eve/manifest.yaml`, the CLI automatically syncs the manifest before deploying (see below).

### Manifest Auto-Sync on Deploy

When `--repo-dir` points to a repository containing `.eve/manifest.yaml`, the CLI automatically syncs the manifest to the API before deploying. This eliminates the separate `eve project sync` step:

1. CLI reads `.eve/manifest.yaml` from the repo directory.
2. Expands workflow `$ref` entries and `agent.prompt_file` prompts, matching
   `eve project sync`.
3. POSTs the expanded manifest YAML with the resolved git SHA and branch to sync.
4. Uses the returned manifest hash for the deploy request.

If no `.eve/manifest.yaml` exists in the repo directory, the CLI falls back to fetching the latest manifest hash from the server (previous behavior).

## Deploy Polling

### Starting a Deploy

```
POST /projects/{projectId}/envs/{envName}/deploy
```

Body requires `release_tag` **or** both `git_sha` + `manifest_hash`. Optional: `image_digests`, `image_tag`, `direct` (bypass pipeline), `inputs`.

### Response Discrimination

Check for `pipeline_run` in the response:
- **Present**: pipeline deploy -- poll the pipeline run, then health check.
- **Absent**: direct deploy -- skip to health check immediately.

### Pipeline Polling

```
GET /projects/{projectId}/pipelines/{pipelineName}/runs/{runId}
```

Terminal statuses: `succeeded` (proceed to health), `failed` (read errors), `cancelled` (aborted). Non-terminal: `pending`, `running`, `awaiting_approval`. Inspect individual steps on failure for `error_message`, `exit_code`, and `logs_ref`.

### Health Check

```
GET /projects/{projectId}/envs/{envName}/health
```

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `ready` | All pods healthy, no in-flight pipeline |
| `deploying` | Pods rolling out or pipeline active |
| `degraded` | Some pods unhealthy |
| `unknown` | K8s unavailable |

The health endpoint is **pipeline-aware**: reports `deploying` while a pipeline run is pending/running, preventing false `ready` from stale pods.

Deploy is complete when all three hold: `ready === true`, `active_pipeline_run === null`, `status === "ready"`.

### Polling Pseudocode

```
response = POST /projects/{id}/envs/{env}/deploy { ... }

if response.pipeline_run:
    run_id   = response.pipeline_run.run.id
    pipeline = response.pipeline_run.run.pipeline_name
    loop every 3-5s, timeout 300s:
        detail = GET /projects/{id}/pipelines/{pipeline}/runs/{run_id}
        if detail.run.status == "succeeded": break
        if detail.run.status in ("failed","cancelled"): FAIL
    loop every 3-5s, timeout 120s:
        health = GET /projects/{id}/envs/{env}/health
        if health.ready and not health.active_pipeline_run: SUCCESS
else:
    loop every 3-5s, timeout 120s:
        health = GET /projects/{id}/envs/{env}/health
        if health.ready: SUCCESS
```

## App Undeploy & Delete Lifecycle

### Environment Undeploy

Take an environment offline without losing config. Tears down K8s namespace but preserves the environment record (variables, secrets bindings, release pointer).

```bash
eve env undeploy <env> --project <id>
eve env show <project> <env> --json   # Verify deploy_status = 'undeployed'
```

Redeploy later: `eve env deploy <env> --ref <sha>`. The `deploy_status` field tracks state: `unknown` | `deployed` | `undeployed` | `deploying` | `undeploying` | `failed`. Deploy/rollback/reset flows update this automatically.

### Project Delete

```bash
eve project delete <project>                # Soft-delete (sets deleted_at)
eve project delete <project> --hard         # Hard-delete with cascading cleanup
eve project delete <project> --hard --force # Continue on partial failures
```

Hard delete: undeploys all environments, cascade-deletes jobs/pipeline-runs/releases/builds/agents/teams/threads, then deletes the project record.

### Org Delete

```bash
eve org delete <org>                        # Soft-delete
eve org delete <org> --hard --force         # Full tenancy teardown
```

### Resource Cleanup

```bash
eve build delete <id>
eve build prune --project <id> --keep 10    # Keep last N
eve release delete <id>
eve release prune --project <id> --keep 10
eve pipeline delete <name> --project <id>
eve agents delete <name> --project <id>
eve thread delete <id>
```

### Debugging Delete Failures

If `--hard` delete fails partway, re-run with `--force` to continue past individual failures. Check for FK constraint errors in API logs -- the migration `00080_fix_project_cascade_deletes.sql` fixes cascades on 11 tables referencing `projects(id)`.

## Environment Variable Interpolation

Manifest environment values support these interpolation variables:

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `${ENV_NAME}` | Environment name | `staging` |
| `${PROJECT_ID}` | Project ID | `proj_01abc...` |
| `${ORG_ID}` | Organization ID | `org_01xyz...` |
| `${ORG_SLUG}` | Organization slug | `acme` |
| `${COMPONENT_NAME}` | Current service name | `api`, `web` |
| `${SSO_URL}` | Platform SSO broker URL | `https://sso.eve.example.com` |
| `${secret.KEY}` | Secret value | `${secret.DB_PASSWORD}` |
| `${managed.<service>.<field>}` | Managed DB value (when provisioned) | `${managed.db.url}` |

## Platform Env Vars (Injected into Deployed Apps)

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `EVE_API_URL` | Internal cluster URL for server-to-server calls |
| `EVE_PUBLIC_API_URL` | Public ingress URL for browser-facing apps |
| `EVE_SSO_URL` | SSO broker URL for user authentication |
| `EVE_PROJECT_ID` | Current project ID |
| `EVE_ORG_ID` | Current org ID |
| `EVE_ENV_NAME` | Current environment name |

Use `EVE_API_URL` for backend calls from containers. Use `EVE_PUBLIC_API_URL` for browser/client-side code.

## Runtime Environment Variables

| Variable | Component | Purpose |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| `ORCH_LOOP_INTERVAL_MS` | Orchestrator | Main claim/dispatch loop cadence |
| `ORCH_CONCURRENCY` | Orchestrator | Base concurrency |
| `ORCH_CONCURRENCY_MIN` / `_MAX` | Orchestrator | Tuner bounds |
| `ORCH_TUNER_ENABLED` | Orchestrator | Enable adaptive tuning |
| `ORCH_TUNER_INTERVAL_MS` | Orchestrator | Tuning check interval |
| `ORCH_TUNER_CPU_THRESHOLD` | Orchestrator | CPU threshold for scaling |
| `ORCH_TUNER_MEMORY_THRESHOLD` | Orchestrator | Memory threshold for scaling |
| `EVE_WORKER_POLL_INTERVAL_MS` | Orchestrator | Poll cadence for worker completion events |
| `EVE_AGENT_RUNTIME_POLL_INTERVAL_MS` | Orchestrator | Poll cadence for agent-runtime completion events |
| `EVE_RUNNER_IMAGE` | Worker | Container image for runner pods |
| `EVE_RUNNER_REAPER_ENABLED` | Worker | Enable pod reaper |
| `EVE_RUNNER_REAPER_INTERVAL_MS` | Worker | Reaper sweep interval |
| `EVE_RUNNER_REAPER_GRACE_SECONDS` | Worker | Grace before cleanup |
| `EVE_WORKSPACE_MAX_GB` | Worker | Total workspace budget per instance |
| `EVE_WORKSPACE_MIN_FREE_GB` | Worker | Hard floor; refuse new claims below |
| `EVE_WORKSPACE_TTL_HOURS` | Worker | Idle TTL for job worktrees |
| `EVE_SESSION_TTL_HOURS` | Worker | Idle TTL for session workspaces |
| `EVE_MIRROR_MAX_GB` | Worker | Cap for bare mirrors |

## Workspace Janitor (Disk Safety)

Policies for production disk management:
- LRU eviction of worktrees when over budget.
- TTL cleanup for idle job/session worktrees.
- Mirror maintenance: `git fetch --prune` + periodic `git gc --prune=now`.
- Emit system events on low disk; refuse new attempts below minimum free space.

K8s: per-attempt PVCs are deleted after completion. Session-scoped PVCs require TTL cleanup and storage quotas.

## Infrastructure Change Policy

All AWS infrastructure changes must go through Terraform in the `deployment-instance-repo` repo. No exceptions.

- **Never** mutate AWS resources (security groups, IAM, DNS, EKS, ASGs) via CLI or console -- Terraform will silently revert them on the next apply, which has caused production outages.
- **Read-only** AWS CLI commands (`describe`, `list`, `get`) are fine for diagnosis.
- If staging infra is broken, fix it in `deployment-instance-repo/terraform/aws/`, run `terraform plan` then `terraform apply`, and verify the plan shows no changes after apply.
- If you lack access to the infra repo, escalate to the user -- do not apply ad-hoc fixes.

## CLI-First Debugging Ladder

1. **CLI first** -- `eve system health`, `eve job diagnose <id>`, `eve job follow <id>`.
2. **Environment status** -- `./bin/eh status` to confirm URLs and running services.
3. **kubectl** only if CLI lacks data.

CLI only needs `EVE_API_URL`: local/docker = `http://localhost:4801`, K8s = `http://api.eve.lvh.me`.

## Debugging Workflows

### Job Won't Start

```bash
eve job show <id> --verbose    # Check phase
eve job dep list <id>          # Check blocked deps
eve job ready --project <id>   # Check ready queue
```

Common causes: phase is not `ready`, blocked by dependencies, orchestrator unhealthy.

### Job Failed

```bash
eve job diagnose <id>          # Status, timeline, attempts, errors, recommendations
eve job logs <id> --attempt N  # Detailed logs for specific attempt
```

### Job Stuck Active

Run `eve job diagnose <id>` — the output is heartbeat-aware:

- **Heartbeat recent** (`<120s`): `▶ Harness alive (last heartbeat 15s ago, 291s elapsed)` — the harness is working, just generating output (e.g., long LLM call).
- **Heartbeat stale** (`>120s`): `⚠ No harness heartbeat for 180s — process may have crashed` — the harness likely crashed. Check `eve job logs <id>`.
- **No heartbeat data**: Falls back to elapsed-time heuristic (warns after 300s).

The diagnose `Latest Attempt` section shows:
- **Pod**: Which agent-runtime pod is running the job (e.g., `eve-agent-runtime-0`)
- **Heartbeat**: Time since last heartbeat and elapsed execution time
- **Pod health**: Live status from the agent-runtime heartbeat system (for active jobs)

```bash
eve job diagnose <id>          # Heartbeat-aware stuck detection + pod context
eve job follow <id>            # Silence warnings at 60s/120s with heartbeat context
eve job logs <id>              # Includes pre-harness startup events (clone, creds)
```

`eve job follow` also has built-in silence detection:
- After **60s** of no output: prints a contextual warning (e.g., "harness alive" if heartbeat is recent, or suggests `eve job diagnose` if no heartbeat data)
- After **120s**: escalated warning. Heartbeat lifecycle events are silently consumed (not printed as log lines) but tracked for silence detection.

### System Issues

```bash
eve system health              # Quick health check
eve system status              # Shows all services INCLUDING agent runtime health
eve system logs api            # API pod logs
eve system logs orchestrator   # Orchestrator logs
eve system logs worker         # Worker logs
eve system logs postgres       # DB logs
```

`eve system status` renders all services with health indicators:
```
Services:
  API: ✓ healthy (vdev)
  Orchestrator: ✓ healthy
  Agent Runtime: ✓ healthy [3 replicas]
  Worker: ✓ healthy
```

If API is unhealthy: check API logs, verify database, confirm `EVE_API_URL`.

### Build Debugging

```bash
eve build list --project <id>       # Recent builds
eve build diagnose <build_id>       # Spec + runs + artifacts + logs
eve build logs <build_id>           # Raw build output
```

Common issues: registry auth (`registry: "eve"` for managed apps; `REGISTRY_USERNAME` + `REGISTRY_PASSWORD` only for BYO/custom registry), Dockerfile path (`build.context`), build backend (BuildKit on K8s, Buildx locally).

## Real-time Debugging

### Three-Terminal Approach

```bash
# Terminal 1: Poll status
watch -n 5 'eve job show <id> --verbose 2>&1 | head -30'

# Terminal 2: Stream harness logs
eve job follow <id>

# Terminal 3 (K8s): Watch runner pod
eve job runner-logs <id>
```

| Command | What It Shows |
|---------|---------------|
| `eve job watch <id>` | Combined status + logs streaming |
| `eve job follow <id>` | Harness JSONL logs (SSE) -- harness output only |
| `eve job runner-logs <id>` | K8s runner pod stdout/stderr |
| `eve job wait <id> --verbose` | Status changes while waiting |

Startup lifecycle events (git clone, credential write, app CLI discovery) now appear in `eve job diagnose` as part of the latency breakdown and in `eve job logs`. The latency waterfall shows timing for each phase:

```
Latency Breakdown:
  secrets         5ms  ░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░   0%
  workspace     552ms  ░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░   2%
  hook        4,815ms  ██░░░░░░░░░░░░░░  14%
  secrets         7ms  ░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░   0%
  harness    28,848ms  █████████████░░░  84%
```

If a clone or credential write fails, the lifecycle `end` event captures `success: false` and the error message.

### Auth / Secrets Failures

```bash
eve secrets show GITHUB_TOKEN --project <proj_id>
eve secrets list --project <proj_id>
```

Check orchestrator/worker logs for `[resolveSecrets]` warnings. Verify `EVE_INTERNAL_API_KEY` and `EVE_SECRETS_MASTER_KEY` are set.

## Common Error Messages

| Error | Meaning | Fix |
|-------|---------|-----|
| "OAuth token has expired" | Claude auth stale | `./bin/eh auth extract --save` then redeploy |
| "git clone failed" | Repo inaccessible | Check GITHUB_TOKEN secret |
| "Service X ready check failed" | Service provisioning issue | Check manifest services, container logs |
| "Orchestrator restarted while attempt was running" | Job orphaned on restart | Auto-retries via recovery |

## Environment-Specific Debugging

**Local dev:** `./bin/eh start local` -- logs at `/tmp/eve-{api,orchestrator,worker}.log`.

**Docker Compose:** `./bin/eh start docker` -- use `docker logs eve-api -f`, `docker logs eve-orchestrator -f`, `docker logs eve-worker -f`.

**Kubernetes:** `./bin/eh k8s start` + `export EVE_API_URL=http://api.eve.lvh.me`. Use `kubectl -n eve get pods | grep runner` and `kubectl -n eve logs -f eve-runner-<attempt-id>` only as last resort.
